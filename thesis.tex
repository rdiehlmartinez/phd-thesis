\abstract{%
Language models continue to grow in size, yet our understanding of their inner workings and ability to train them efficiently, particularly smaller models, remains limited. Small models offer practical benefits like lower costs and enhanced privacy, motivating the need for improved training methodologies. This thesis addresses the challenge of efficient language modeling through two complementary lenses: cognitive inspiration and analytical investigation. Firstly, drawing parallels with efficient human language acquisition, we explore cognitively-inspired techniques. Chapter 2 investigates curriculum learning strategies based on infant development within data constraints, while Chapter 3 introduces Syntactic Smoothing to mitigate frequency bias and anisotropy, improving the representation of infrequent words by leveraging syntactic information. Secondly, we adopt an analytical perspective to understand training dynamics and bottlenecks in small models. Chapter 4 examines convergence challenges and saturation phenomena by analyzing layer dynamics in the Pythia model suite, linking slower convergence to parameter rank issues. Chapter 5 presents Pico, a lightweight, modular framework comprising pico-train and pico-analyze, designed specifically to facilitate the training and fine-grained analysis of model learning dynamics (weights, gradients, activations) at smaller scales. Ultimately, this work contributes novel methods and tools aimed at making the training of small language models more efficient and understandable.
